            <span> My name is Henry Domingo and I’m a 1st year at Smash UC Berkeley.  I currently attend Envision Academy and I grew up in East Oakland practically all my life.  I enjoy activities that include being active or using your brain.  I’m a shy person so I don’t like being put in the spotlight a lot of the times.  However, I’m willing to do almost anything, even if it is very nerve-wracking for me or embarrassing.  I’ll never give up in achieving my goals and I’ll work hard to obtain the things I want.  As for my future I want to do everything possible which may be impossible, but I’d settle for a career that pays really well, so that I can one day make a successful company of my own.

            <span>My name is Kethya Kas and I’m a rising 14 year old Cambodian sophomore at Henry T. Gunderson High School in San Jose. I’m also a first year at SMASH Berkeley. My hobbies include playing card games and video games. One card game I mainly play is Yu-Gi-Oh. I mainly play Overwatch and Halo games on the Xbox One (Hope Halo: Infinite is great). I do not play on a sports team currently, but I plan to join the badminton team in the upcoming year. For I future career, I hope to become a software engineer (Which is ironic because I am not the lead programmer of the website). Fun Fact: both mascots of Gunderson High School and UC Berkeley are bears, but Gunderson High School’s mascot is specifically the grizzly bear</span>
